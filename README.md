# Drift Chamber Simulation

The Belle II collaboration is currently working to replace and upgrade their Central Drift Chamber. This software was developed to conduct some preliminary modelling and data collection in Garfield++ and Geant4 in preparation for this upgrade. 

This simulation creates a Geant4 geometry modelled off of the current Belle II Central Drift Chamber (CDC). The specifications for the detector are read from `geometry.json`, which currently specifies various properties based on the [2010 Belle II Technical Design Report](https://docs.belle2.org/files/4270/BELLE2-REPORT-2016-001/1/BELLE2-REPORT-2016-001.pdf) (pp. 202–208).

<summary>&nbsp<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Toolkit Installations</span></summary>
<br>

This simulation utilizes various toolkits that must be installed before attempting to run. The following are instructions for installing the necessary versions.

### ROOT
[ROOT](https://root.cern/) is a C++ data collection and analysis framework. It can be installed using CERN's [ROOT Installation Guide](https://root.cern/install/).

### Geant4
[Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) is a toolkit for simulating particles through matter. This simulation is built to utilize the [v11.4.1 of Geant4](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/tree/v11.4.1), which can be installed by following the [Geant4 Installation Guide](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/documentation/dev/ig_html/InstallationGuide/).

### Garfield++
[Garfield++](https://garfieldpp.docs.cern.ch/) is a toolkit for gaseous particle physics detectors. This simulation requires the [5.0 release](https://gitlab.cern.ch/garfield/garfieldpp/-/tree/5.0?ref_type=tags), which can be installed as follows:
```
git clone --branch 5.0 https://gitlab.cern.ch/garfield/garfieldpp.git $GARFIELD_HOME
cd garfieldpp
mkdir install
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DGARFIELD_WITH_GSL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install/ -DWITH_EXAMPLES=OFF  ../
make
make install
source ../install/share/Garfield/setupGarfield.sh
```
In this version, the path to `libomp` is broken. This can be fixed by directly copying the file from your installation location to the correct library. Example command:
```
brew install libomp
cp /opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/22.1.8/lib/libomp.dylib ../install/lib/
```
### JSON Parser
This simulation uses the [nlohmann C++ json parser](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to read in its geometry. On macOS, this can be installed using: ```brew install nlohmann-json```.

<summary>&nbsp<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Running Files</span></summary>
<br>

Once the directory is replaced, set up the environmental variables for Garfield++, Geant4, and ROOT. An example of this may look like:
```
source ~/garfieldpp/install/share/Garfield/setupGarfield.sh
source ~/geant4/source/bin/geant4.sh
source /opt/homebrew/Cellar/root/6.40.02_1/bin/thisroot.sh
```
Following this, the simulation can be run using the Geant4 visualization UI:

```
cd DriftChamberSim/build/
cmake ../
chmod +x *.sh
./run_DCSim.sh
```

### Random Seed
The initial momentum of each simulated particle is generated randomly. The seed for the random generator can be optionally set by passing it as a command line argument, e.g. `./run_DCSim.sh 12345`

### Gas Files
To run the Garfield++ section of the simulation, a `.gas` file is needed describing the properties of the gas mixture specified in `geometry.json`. Some sample files have been provided in `gas_files` and additional gas files can be made by modifying and running Garfield++'s [GasFile example](https://gitlab.cern.ch/garfield/garfieldpp/-/blob/master/Examples/GasFile/generate.C). This process takes approximately 2 hours to complete. 

### Warning
After the trajectories have loaded in the GUI, do NOT close the GUI window until the GUI menu info has printed to the terminal. This is the section of the output that begins with:
```
#
# This file permits to customize, with commands,
# the menu bar of the G4UIXm, G4UIQt, G4UIWin32 sessions.
# It has no effect with G4UIterminal.
#
# File menu :
.
.
.
```
If the window is closed early, a segmentation fault will occur and no data will be saved.

<summary>&nbsp<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Output</span></summary>
<br>

The simulation outputs a ROOT file of simulation data, as well as four helper files for the provided KalmanFit analysis program. `run_DCSim.sh` provides an option to save these outputs to a filepath.

- `particle_and_track_data.root` - data about each particle sent through the drift chamber during the simulation, including the particle's initial position and momentum, as well as the times, energies, and positions of the particle as it passed through each layer in the cell. Includes a separate branch for delta rays.
- `drift_times_lookup.csv` - a lookup table of sample drift times (in ns) of electrons originating at various positions in a drift cell; each cell of the csv file correponds to a 1mm x 1mm section of the drift cell
- `diffusion_lookup.csv` - a lookup table of sample diffusion coefficients (in sqrt(cm)) of electrons originating at various positions in a drift cell; each cell of the csv file contains two values separated by a bar ( *longitudinal diffusion*|*transverse diffusion* ) correponds to a 1mm x 1mm section of the drift cell 
- `layer_radius.csv` - a list of details about each sublayer of the detector, including inner and outer radii and wire dimensional information

Sample output can be found in `SampleData`.

**All data output is in Geant4 default units [mm, MeV, ns, eplus, radian] unless otherwise specified!**

<summary>&nbsp<span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Analysis</span></summary>
<br>

To inspect the simulation data, a ROOT TBrowser can be opened using the following:
```
root particle_and_track_data.root
gSystem->Load("libDriftChamberlib.so");
TBrowser b
```

### KalmanFit
`KalmanFit` is a tool used to estimate the trajectory of particles using a [Kalman fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) algorithm built using [GenFit2](https://github.com/GenFit/GenFit), a framework for track reconstruction. A shell script has been provided to run this tool using `./run_kalman_fitter`. 

All reconstructed Kalman fit data will be output to the terminal (a sample output can be found in `SampleData/kalmanFit_output.txt`) and saved to a ROOT file. 

`kalman_output.root` - Outputs the position and momentum data of the particle points along its trajectory. Includes two branches: one for the actual simulation data and one for the reconstructed Kalman fitted data. 

This output can be opened in a TBrowser using the same method as above, loading the same library before opening, or by using the provided Jupyter Notebook. Sample output can be found in `SampleData`.

For a single track from the simulation, the reconstruction also generates clusters along the track segment in each layer and outputs a file `cluster_info.csv` with the drift time and diffusion values.

### Jupyter Notebook
Plotting options for data output by the KalmanFit tool, such as for comparing the actual and reconstructed trajectories and plotting the signal for cluster counting, are provided in `simulation_analysis.ipynb`.
